//! Experimental host-side USB stack for embedded devices.
//!
//! `usbh` aims to abstract between two things:
//!  
//! - embedded USB host controllers on one side
//! - function specific USB drivers on the other side
//!  
//! The goal is that a driver can be developed independently from the specific host controller hardware, similarly to the `usb-device` crate allowing implementing USB functions independently of the USB device controller.
//!  
//! ## Implementing drivers
//!
//! Please check out the [documentation for the `driver` module](crate::driver).
//!
//! ## Adding support for new hardware
//!
//! Since this project is in an early stage, this area is largely unexplored.
//!
//! The [`bus` module](crate::bus) contains a `HostBus` trait, which must be implemented for the target hardware.
//!
//! If you are planning to implement support for a new hardware, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nilclass/usbh/issues/new?title=Hardware%20support%20for:%20...), so we can figure out together if any additions or changes to the HostBus interface are necessary to accomodate it.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The code block below shows a brief example, leaving out any hardware and driver specifics.
//!
//! For a full example, please check out the [rp-hal-usb-host-example](https://github.com/nilclass/rp-hal-usb-host-example) which contains a runnable example, targeting RP2040 based boards.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use usbh::{
//!     UsbHost,
//!     PollResult,
//! };
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // must implement usbh::bus::HostBus
//!     let host_bus = hardware_specific_host_bus_initialization();
//!
//!     let usb_host = UsbHost::new(host_bus);
//!
//!     // these must implement usbh::driver::Driver;
//!     let mut driver1 = create_first_driver();
//!     let mut driver2 = create_second_driver();
//!
//!     // (leaving out details on how to share `usb_host` and `driver*` with the interrupt routine)
//! }
//!
//! #[...]
//! fn USB_IRQ() {
//!     match usb_host.poll(&mut [&mut driver1, &mut driver2]) {
//!         PollResult::BusError(error) => {
//!             // something went wrong
//!         }
//!         PollEvent::DiscoveryError(device_address) => {
//!             // device with specified address misbehaved during discovery (it will likely not be usable)
//!         }
//!         PollResult::NoDevice => {
//!             // no device is currently connected
//!         }
//!         Event::Busy => {
//!             // Host is currently busy with a transfer.
//!             // Trying to start a transfer now will return `WouldBlock`.
//!         }
//!         Event::Idle => {
//!             // Host is not currently handling any transfer.
//!             // A new transfer can be started, if desired.
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     // After polling the USB host, the drivers may have new things to report:
//!     if let Some(event) = driver1.take_event() {
//!        // ...
//!     }
//!     if driver2.something_something() {
//!        // ...
//!     }
//! }

///
/// At any time, the UsbHost is in one of **five phases**. **Four** of these are shown in this diagram:
///
/// ![Diagram showing enumeration, discovery, configuration and configured phase, and their transitions][usb-host-phases]
///
/// When a new device is connected to the host, the host moves through these phases, ending up either in the *configured* stage (at which point drivers
/// can take over communication with the device), or in the *dormant* phase (not shown), if no driver is interested in the device.
///
/// If there is an error communicating with the device in any of the previous stages, the device also ends up in the dormant phase.
///
/// Finally, if the device is disconnected, regardless of the current phase, the host returns to the Enumeration phase
/// (there is one exception to this: within the enumeration phase, two resets are performed, during which the device will
/// "disconnect" and "connect" again - these disconnects do not return to the initial enumeration state).
///
/// For a more detailed description of these phases, check out the [documentation for the Driver interface](crate::driver).
